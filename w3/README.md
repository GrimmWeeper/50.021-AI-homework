```python semi-magic.py```

## Q3

The lesser the number of assignments, the more effective the backtracking methods in solving this CSP. The minimum number of assignments possible is 9 for this question and it is observed that backtracking with MRV, LCV and AC-3 consistently produce the minimum number even after randomising the variables. Hence, it is the most effective.
